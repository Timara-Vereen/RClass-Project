# RClass-Project
The ojective of this project was to determine the effects of Eastern mud snails on benthic microalgae community structures. The data for this project was collected in October 2021. In a mudflat in Grice Cove, in Charleston, SC, we experimented with the manipulation of snail removal through the construction of 3 treatments: Snails, No snails, and ambient. Sediment samples were collected for analysis of chlorophyll a (CHLA), Organic matter (OM), and DNA for DNA sequencing (Summer 2022) Sediment levels were documented using erosion pins over the course of the experiment. The samples were collected on T0 (Day 0) and T14 (Day 14). The data was analyzed using an ANOVA with the data being represented within boxplots with lines of regression. 
I would like to thank my mentors, Dr. Craig Plante, Kristy Hill-Spanik, and Josiah Waters for helping me with this project. Also, huge thanks to faculty and staff at Grice, Kevin Spanik, and my fellow REU peers for assisting me as well. Spacial thanks to Dr. Dan McGlinn for teaching me to code and further understand the beauty and importance of R and GitHub.
